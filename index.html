                <p>I’m an American essayist, poet, editor, and occasionally a translator of Russian verse.</p>

<p>I have an undergraduate degree in English from Harvard and half a master’s in Art History from the European University in St Petersburg, Russia. Since 2018, I’ve been editing at Hypocrite Reader (founded 2011), which bills itself as “a leftist magazine of useful, unexpected writing.” During my time there, I’ve revived the magazine, refined its mission, made it a paying market, and helped expand the editorial staff sixfold. My first book of translations, a collection of poems by Ekaterina Simonova, came out in 2022.</p>

<p>The jobs I’ve held include janitor, library clerk, barista, cashier, SAT tutor, barback, curriculum development researcher, administrative assistant at a climate nonprofit, web designer, and freelancer editor/translator. My adult life seems to have ended up with four geographic centers: Iowa City, where my family is from and where I lived for two different spans after college; New York City, where I was born at St Vincent’s Hospital and have managed to live for brief periods including most of 2022; Massachusetts, where I went to school in Cambridge and now live with my partner in Holyoke; and St. Petersburg, Russia, where I studied in 2014 and 2019-20. I grew up in Florida.</p>

<p>Mostly, I just try to stay moving.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing-projects">Ongoing Projects</h2>

<p>I’m working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an extended interview with South African textile artist Lawrence Lemaoana</li>
  <li>a long text tentatively entitled “revolutionary serialization for neurodivergent gremlins”</li>
  <li>an essay on sex, AI, and paranoia</li>
  <li>a book of poems</li>
  <li>an approach to reading magic in fantasy literature</li>
</ul>

<p>I think a lot about sign systems (programming, math, semiotics, psychoanalysis, language use, literature), theories of change (evolutionary biology, linguistics, Marxism and political economy), accounting practices (debt and finance), cultural anthropology (ethnography, communication styles, ways of seeing and reading environments), and abolition.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve also been really interested in science fiction, standup comedy, cooking, and Eastern European dissident poetry.</p>
